### 🧠 What I Do

I work on production backend systems that power AI products — from data ingestion
pipelines and async workers to APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure.

I care about:
- system boundaries and data flow
- failure handling, retries, and idempotency
- cost-aware AI workloads
- shipping fast without accumulating bad tech debt
